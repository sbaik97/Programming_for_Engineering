## Task 5. Solvint the differential equations 
This assignment shows how to solve differential equations with analytical and numerical methods, create plots to visualize the solutions, and use loops to perform the calculations.

1. Loops
2. Solve ordinary differential equations


## 5-1 Loop methods
This problem explores different methods to solve differential equations. One of the methods will use a loop to calculate the step forward from one time point to calculate the next. A loop is implemented with either for or while.
