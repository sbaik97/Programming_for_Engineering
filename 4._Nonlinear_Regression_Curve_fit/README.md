## Task 4: Nonlinear Regression Curve Fit

This assignment is about fitting models to data and analyzing data to determine statistical quantities. Data analysis is a major part of an engineer's ability to extract useful and actionable information from data.

* Nonlinear regression

* Statistical and other 

* Create bar plot
